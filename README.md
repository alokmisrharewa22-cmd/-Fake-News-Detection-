## 🚀 Features
- Fake vs Real news detection
- Streamlit-based interactive UI
- NLP text preprocessing
- Machine Learning prediction model
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters news text
2. Text is cleaned and vectorized using TF-IDF
3. Machine learning model predicts Fake or Real
4. Result is shown instantly
## ▶️ How to Run

streamlit run app.py
